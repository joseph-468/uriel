## Compilation
The engine is only designed to be developed on x64 Windows but as SDL is cross platform it can be compiled to other platforms if you link and compile everything yourself. \
SDL2.dll, SDL2_image.dll, SDL2_ttf.dll and SDL2_mixer.dll are all required to be in the same directory as the executable.

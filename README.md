## Purpose
This is a small library I made to make SDL development simpler. \
There is a demo "game" within the repo that I made so I knew what features I would need to add.
## Compilation
The engine is only designed to be developed on x64 Windows but the release build **should** be cross compatible with all major operating systems with some changing. \
SDL2.dll, SDL2_image.dll, SDL2_ttf.dll and SDL2_mixer.dll are all required to be in the same directory as the executable.

## Goals
Create a well documented game engine. \
Create a game alongside the engine. \
Have a few people play the game and/or use the engine for their own game.
## Compilation
The engine is only designed to be developed on x64 Windows but the release build **should** be cross compatible with all major operating systems. \
SDL2.dll, SDL2_image.dll and SDL2_mixer.dll are all required to be in the same directory as the executable.
